Hello 👋  I am a software developer passionate about machine learning and all things computer vision-related.

I am a uWaterloo alumni with a MMath in Computer Science and BMath in Actuarial Science & Statistics.

As a "retired" actuary, I try to be up-to-date with changes in the insurance industry, so I may post things insurance-related occasionally. Stay tuned!
